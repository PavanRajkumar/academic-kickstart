Hello There! I'm a final year undergraduate student at CMR Institute of Technology located in Bangalore, India. I was recently introduced to the research world and really enjoyed the process of studying and developing new ideas which have never been implemented before! I'm still new to the whole research field and am still discovering what are my true interests but in the mean time I have been working on research which involves using AI solutions in healthcare applications. You can find some of the stuff I'm working on in the research tab above. Also in my free time I've been exploring the depths of Computational Neuroscience which I find very interesting.
