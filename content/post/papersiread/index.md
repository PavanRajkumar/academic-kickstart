<div style="text-align: justify">
This is a list of some interesting papers I've read while doing my research work. I keep looking for new ideas to work on and keeping a list like this has so far helped really well. Big thanks to Alexandra Elbakyan, creator of Sci-Hub, without whom most of this reading would'nt have been possible.
