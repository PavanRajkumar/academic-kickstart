abstract: "Trying to minimize the number of software failures is one of the most
important goals in the area of software project management. In software
development, which is a part of software project management, incremental
changes are typically made to an existing set of code and documents that
may be initially empty. This goal becomes more crucial due to short
delivery schedules that constrain coding, inspection and testing. In this
paper, we deal with one aspect of the above scenario, where we predict,
using machine learning techniques, the risk associated with changing a
software code segment based on a set of parameters associated with that
segment. We decide on a set of features relevant to a segment of code and
create different types of machine learning models based on those features
to predict the risk associated (in terms of probability of failure) with a
change in that segment. We then decide on various evaluation criteria
and compare and show the best models that work in this scenario."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "Predicting the risk and impact of newly introduced code into a project codebase. Using supervised machine learning to classify new code as bug inducing or not. Comparing performance on neural networks, naive-bayes, SVMs, random forests, and logistic regression."
