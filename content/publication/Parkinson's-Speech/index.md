abstract: "Speech impairments analysis has been used as an efficient tool for the early detection of Parkinson’s disease (PD). In this paper, we explore explainable models for the proposed Neural Network, SVM, and Random Forest model developed to classify PD patients from the non-Pd patients utilizing the speech samples. The performance of the method has been assessed with a reliable dataset from the UCI repository. The proposed achieves an accuracy of 71.6%, 74.5%, and 68.75% for the neural network, random forest, and the SVM model respectively. Explanable models for the neural network and SVM have been generated with the help of LIME. The obtained results are compared with the results of the random forest model obtained by backtracking its decision path to obtain the most contributing features. The results are compared and its necessity is studied for explainable decision support in medicine."
